# How to Run

Will run with just basic python 3.0+ and Numpy.

## Future Improvements if Revisted:
  - [x] Allow for User to have continous inputs
  - [ ] Create a log book of every transaction between each person instead of just fulfilling the order and letting nothing else happen
  - [ ] Testing to see if I can optimize the program further.
