# How to Run

Will run with just basic python 3.0+. 

## Future Improvements if Revisted:
  -[x] Allow for User to have continous inputs
  -[x] Create a log book of every transaction between each person instead of just fulfilling the order and letting nothing else happen
  -[x] Testing to see if I can optimize the program further.
