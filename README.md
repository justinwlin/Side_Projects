# Side_Projects

## About
These are side projects that I work on to try to get better in programming or to just explore something that interests me. 

### Finished Projects:
#### [OrderBook Simulator](https://github.com/justinwlin/Side_Projects/tree/master/OrderBook%20Prototype)
- Worked on creating an Orderbook Prototype to explore some concepts with data structure and as a fun competition between me and my friend. 
- Applied concepts such as: maps, deque, and Big-O-Notation to try and optimize the program.
